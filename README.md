### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a software developer with a lifelong passion for programming, language, and music. I enjoy solving problems with code, and collaborating with others. My specialties include JavaScript technologies (Node.js, React.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js), HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Flask, SQL and NoSQL databases, and building RESTful APIs.

I previously worked as a full-stack developer for a medical startup company, and currently work for a music tech startup. I love using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives!

I also have some passion projects, ranging from web applications to Twitch chat bots. Check out my repos for more information!
