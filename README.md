### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a software developer with a lifelong passion for programming, language, and music. I enjoy solving problems with code, and collaborating with others. My specialties include JavaScript technologies (Node.js, React.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js), HTML, CSS, Python, Django, Flask, SQL and NoSQL databases, and building RESTful APIs.

#### I currently work as a Front End Developer for a medical startup company. I love using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives!
